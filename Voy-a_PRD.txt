Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Voy-a (MVP)

1. Vision

Voy-a is a travel platform that transforms the chaos of saved content from Instagram, TikTok, and
Pinterest into a structured trip itinerary. Instead of scattered screenshots and bookmarks, Voy-a
consolidates inspirations into a map, itinerary, and style board, tailored to the traveler’s trip dates and
hotel location.

2. Core Value Proposition

- Before the Trip: Collect all saved spots (restaurants, shops, museums, neighborhoods, outfits) in one
place.

- During the Trip: Instantly view them on a map around your hotel, with an auto-generated itinerary and
style board/outfits section.

- After the Trip: Preserve memories and recommendations, keeping them organized for future reuse or
sharing.
