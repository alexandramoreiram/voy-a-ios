Voy-a: MVP Execution Plan 

1. Project Summary 

Vision: To create Voy-a, a travel platform that organizes saved social media content (from 
Instagram, TikTok, etc.) into a structured trip itinerary, complete with a map, schedule, and 
style board. 

Target Audience: The primary users are Gen Z travelers (18-30), urban explorers, and 
meticulous planners who are active on social media and want a more organized way to plan 
their trips. 

MVP Goal: The main objective of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to validate the core 
assumption that users will manually input their saved travel inspirations in exchange for a 
consolidated and organized trip plan. 

2. Phase 1: MVP Build & Launch (Months 0-3) 

This initial phase focuses on developing the core features necessary to deliver the 
fundamental value proposition to early adopters. 

Month 1: Foundational Setup & Landing Page 

●  Week 1-2: Project Kickoff & Technical Foundation 

○  Finalize technology stack: Next.js/React for the frontend, Supabase/Firebase 

for the backend, and Mapbox/Google Maps for mapping. 

○  Set up development environments, version control (Git), and project 

management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello). 

○  Develop initial data models for Users, Trips, Places, and Outfits. 

●  Week 3-4: Landing Page & User Authentication 

○  Design and develop a minimal, clean landing page that clearly explains 

Voy-a's value. 
Integrate an email capture form for the waitlist. 
Implement user signup and login functionality. 

○ 
○ 

Month 2: Core Feature Development 

●  Week 5-6: Trip Creation & Manual "Add Place" Flow 

○  Build the "Create a Trip" feature, allowing users to input a city, dates, and 

hotel information. 

○  Develop the manual "Add Place" form with fields for place name, URL, 

category, and notes. 
Integrate a geocoding service to convert place names into map coordinates. 

○ 

●  Week 7-8: The Dashboard - Map & List Views 

○  Develop the main dashboard. 
○ 
Implement the Map View, displaying all saved places as pins. 
○  Build the List View, showing places with quick links and details. 

Month 3: Itinerary, Outfits & Launch 

●  Week 9-10: Itinerary Builder & Outfit Board 

○  Develop the Itinerary Builder, which will auto-generate a schedule based on 

the saved places. 

○  Create the Outfit Board, allowing users to upload images to a gallery. 

●  Week 11-12: Testing, Deployment & Launch 

○  Conduct thorough internal testing to ensure all features work as expected. 
○  Deploy the web application to Vercel/Netlify. 
○  Launch the landing page and begin collecting signups from the waitlist. 

Phase 1 Deliverables: 

●  A live landing page with an active email capture form. 
●  A functional web application where users can sign up, create a trip, and manually 

add places. 

●  A dashboard that includes a map view, list view, itinerary, and outfit board. 

3. Phase 1.5: User Feedback & Enhancements (Months 
3-6) 

This phase will run parallel to the initial user onboarding and will focus on adding high-value 
features requested by early users. 

●  Chrome Extension: Develop a browser extension to allow users to save links and 

content directly from websites. 

●  Smart Suggestions: Implement a basic algorithm to group nearby places, 

suggesting logical daily itineraries. 

●  Trip Export: Add functionality to export the itinerary as a PDF or a shareable link. 

4. Phase 2: Expansion & Growth (Months 6-12) 

Based on the success of the MVP and the feedback from the initial user base, the focus will 
shift to mobile and social features. 

●  Mobile App: Begin development of a native mobile application for iOS and Android. 
●  Social Integration: Explore and integrate with social media APIs to automate the 

process of saving content. 

●  Partnerships: Investigate potential partnerships with travel bloggers, influencers, 

and hospitality brands. 

5. Success Metrics for MVP 

The success of the initial MVP will be measured by the following: 

●  Users can successfully create a trip in under two minutes. 
●  Users can add at least five places without encountering errors. 
●  All saved spots are accurately displayed on the map and itinerary. 
●  The landing page successfully captures a target number of email signups. 

6. Risks and Mitigation 

●  Risk: Delays in social media API integration. 

○  Mitigation: The MVP relies on manual entry, which de-risks this for the initial 

launch. 

●  Risk: High costs for mapping and geocoding services as the user base grows. 

○  Mitigation: Monitor API usage closely and explore more cost-effective plans 

or alternative providers as needed. 

●  Risk: Competitors with similar features. 

○  Mitigation: Focus on creating a superior user experience and building a 

strong community around the product.
